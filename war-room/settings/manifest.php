 * War room — settings manifest. See includes/capabilities.php.

 * USING the war room is deliberately plain module access — during an outage you
 * do not want a permission sitting between an analyst and the only chat that
 * still works, and that includes creating a channel or opening a DM. What IS
 * gated is the pair of decisions an administrator owns: how long messages are
 * kept, and which AI provider gets shown the transcript.
