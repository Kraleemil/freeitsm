/**
 * Documents maintenance — extraction and tidy-up (discussion #76).
 *
 * Two jobs that both want a clock rather than a page load:
 *
 *   1. EXTRACT the text from uploaded files so their CONTENTS are searchable.
 *      Uploading runs one file with a four-second budget, which is right for a
 *      page load and useless for somebody who has just attached fifty warranty
 *      PDFs. Without this they sit `pending` until the next upload happens to
 *      nudge the queue.
 *
 *   2. COLLECT ORPHANS. document_links.parent_id is polymorphic, so no foreign
 *      key can protect it: delete a contract and its links survive. The document
 *      is invisible from that moment — every permission check verifies the parent
 *      still exists — but it is never collected, so the file stays on disk.
 *
 * ⚠️ Neither is required for the feature to be CORRECT. Nothing leaks and nothing
 * is lost without it. What you get is documents that become searchable promptly
 * and disk that does not fill with files nobody can reach.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   php scripts/documents_maintenance.php                 both jobs, default limits
 *   php scripts/documents_maintenance.php --extract=25    read up to 25 files
 *   php scripts/documents_maintenance.php --no-collect    extraction only
 *   php scripts/documents_maintenance.php --quiet         for cron
 *
 * Suggested schedule: every 5 minutes. It is safe to run concurrently — the
 * extractor claims rows before working on them, and returns claims a dead worker
 * abandoned.
