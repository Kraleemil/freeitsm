/**
 * API: Tickets — "read this ticket for me" (discussion #104, idea 12).
 *
 *   GET  ?ticket_id=N   the briefing already written, and whether it is behind
 *   POST { ticket_id }  write a new one
 *
 * A different question from the maintained summary. The summary is a standing
 * description of where a ticket stands; this is what you want at the moment you
 * open one cold — what happened, and what should I do next.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔑 IT IS KEPT, AND IT IS VERSIONED.
 *
 * The first version of this stored nothing at all, on the reasoning that a
 * stored suggestion becomes a fact the next person reads without knowing a
 * machine wrote it. Ed's answer, which is the better one: the actual experience
 * of the unstored version is waiting a minute for a briefing you have already
 * read. The "it becomes a fact" worry is answered exactly the way the summary
 * answers it — it carries the time it was written, what it read, an AI label,
 * and a line saying how many messages have arrived since.
 *
 * So it shares the summary's table with `kind = 'read'` and inherits its rules:
 * a re-read writes version n+1, nothing is ever overwritten, and every earlier
 * version stays readable.
 *
 * ⚠️ Reopening it costs NOTHING. The GET answers from the table and never
 * touches the provider; only a re-read spends anything.
 *
 * Uses the Tickets AI provider (ns=tickets_reply_cleanup).
