    // ⚠️ THIS CHECK MUST STAY ABOVE THE TWO COUNTS BELOW.
    //
    // This endpoint had no company check of any kind: any signed-in analyst with the
    // tickets module could delete any customer contact on the install, including one
    // belonging to a company they cannot see. It is the sibling of the save_user.php
    // hole (S1) — same table, same module, opposite verb — and was reported by Erlend
    // Volden alongside it.
    //
    // Position is half the fix. The two "cannot delete, this user is on N ticket(s)"
    // refusals below are computed from a plain `WHERE user_id = ?` with no tenancy
    // clause, so running them first would answer "does contact 412 exist, and how much
    // work is attached to them?" for every company on the install, and answer it
    // accurately, before refusing. That is a cross-tenant oracle whether or not the
    // DELETE is ever reached. Nothing may be measured about a contact the caller
    // cannot reach.
    //
    // The refusal deliberately matches the one for an id that does not exist, exactly
    // as save_user.php's edit guard does: a scoped analyst must not be able to tell
    // "not yours" from "not there".
