/**
 * API Endpoint: the public web address used in links FreeITSM sends out.
 *
 * Read by the Email Templates settings tab, which needs three different facts and
 * not one:
 *   - `base_url`      what an administrator typed, so the field can show it;
 *   - `is_configured` whether anything was typed AT ALL, which is the only thing
 *                     that can be trusted from cron — this is what decides whether
 *                     [ticket_url] gets a warning;
 *   - `effective_url` what a link would actually come out as right now, which on
 *                     this request includes the host header and so looks fine even
 *                     when nothing is configured. Shown as an example, never used
 *                     to decide whether to warn.
 *
 * The third one is the trap this endpoint exists to avoid: an admin looking at a
 * perfectly good sample URL would reasonably conclude everything is set up, when
 * the same link built at 3am by the mail collector would have no host in it.
