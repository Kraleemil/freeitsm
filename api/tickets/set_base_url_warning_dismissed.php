/**
 * API Endpoint: acknowledge the "no public web address is set" warning.
 *
 * Stored as system_settings 'public_base_url_warning_dismissed'.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DISMISSIBLE AT ALL. The warning fires when a template uses
 * [ticket_url] and nothing is configured, which is very often a real fault — but
 * not always. An install whose templates are only ever sent by an analyst pressing
 * something, on a single host with no reverse proxy, gets a working link from the
 * request every time. Telling that administrator they have a problem on every visit
 * for the rest of the install's life is how a warning stops being read, taking the
 * ones that matter with it. Same rule as the mailbox health marks: warnings can be
 * acknowledged, errors never (see includes/mailbox_health.php).
 *
 * Dismissing is per install rather than per person, because the thing being
 * acknowledged is a fact about the install, not a preference. Setting the address
 * later resolves it for everyone regardless of what was dismissed.
