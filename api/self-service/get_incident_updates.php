 * API: the external updates on one incident, for the self-service portal (#99).
 * GET ?incident_id=
 *
 * Loaded on demand when somebody expands an incident, because the requester
 * asked for the history to be collapsed by default and most people reading a
 * status page never open one.
 *
 * 🔴 The `is_internal = 0` filter is NOT here. It lives in
 * ssPortalIncidentUpdates(), which is the only thing this endpoint calls, so
 * there is exactly one place that decides what an end user may read — and it is
 * the same place the dashboard uses. An endpoint that did its own filtering
 * would be a second copy of that rule, and the second copy is the one that gets
 * it wrong.
