<?php
/**
 * Serve a file attached to a SHARED ticket note, to the requester who raised
 * that ticket.
 *
 * Notes could carry files from the moment note attachments arrived (discussion
 * #69), but only INTERNAL notes could: a shared note had to drop them, because
 * the portal had no way to hand a document back and offering one would have been
 * a promise to the requester that was never kept. That limitation is what this
 * endpoint removes (discussion #103).
 *
 * This is the portal twin of api/documents/download.php, exactly as
 * api/self-service/get_attachment.php is the portal twin of the analyst-side
 * attachment route. The difference is the authorisation model: the analyst
 * version asks "may this analyst reach this document", this one asks "did this
 * requester raise the ticket the document hangs off, and is the note it hangs
 * off one they are allowed to read".
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  THE RULE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Both halves are ONE join, not two checks:
 *
 *     documents -> document_links (parent_type='ticket_note')
 *               -> ticket_notes  (is_internal = 0)
 *               -> tickets       (user_id = this requester)
 *
 * An internal note's files are therefore unreachable BY CONSTRUCTION rather than
 * by a separate condition somebody could later forget, reorder, or short-circuit.
 * A miss is a 404 whatever the reason, so a wrong id and somebody else's id are
 * indistinguishable from outside and ids cannot be enumerated into another
 * customer's files.
 *
 * Only `parent_type = 'ticket_note'` is served. Documents hanging off assets,
 * contracts, changes or anything else are NOT portal material and must not
 * become reachable because they happen to share a table.
