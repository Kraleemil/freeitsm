/**
 * API: The equipment assigned to the signed-in portal user (discussion #57).
 *
 * ⚠️ This endpoint is the whole of the portal's permission rule, and it is a
 * deliberately narrow one: a portal user may only ever attach equipment that is
 * assigned to THEM. There is no search, no browsing, and no id parameter — the
 * user is taken from the session and nothing else is reachable.
 *
 * That does leave shared equipment out of a user's reach: nobody is assigned the
 * TV in a meeting room, so it cannot be picked here. That is the accepted
 * behaviour, not an oversight — the alternatives (exposing every unassigned
 * asset, or asking end users to understand a "shared" flag) were judged more
 * confusing and more leaky than letting an analyst attach it afterwards.
