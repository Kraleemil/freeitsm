/**
 * API: Contracts an asset could be added to (discussion #106).
 * GET ?asset_id=&q=
 *
 * The mirror of api/contracts/search_contract_assets.php, for linking from the
 * equipment's side. Somebody standing on a new handset should not have to go and
 * find the agreement first.
 *
 * ⚠️ Gated on BOTH modules. Assets, because it is the asset's page; contracts,
 * because it lists contract numbers and titles. An analyst with equipment access
 * and no contracts access must not be able to read the contract register through
 * a search box on an asset.
 *
 * No tenancy filter on the contracts themselves — contracts carry no tenant_id.
 * The ASSET is checked, which is the only half of the pair that belongs to a
 * company at all. See includes/contract_assets.php.
