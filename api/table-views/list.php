/**
 * API: saved views for one table (discussion #96).
 * GET ?table_key=assets&q=
 *
 * Returns the views this analyst can see — their own, ones shared with a team
 * they belong to, and public ones. Also returns the teams they could share
 * into, so the editor can offer them without a second request, and the id of
 * their default view for this table.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT gated on one module. Four different modules run this table, so the
 * gate is the table_key itself: you are asking for views of a table you are
 * already looking at, and every view is filtered by who may see it. Gating on
 * 'assets' would refuse somebody using the tasks table.
