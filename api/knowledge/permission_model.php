/**
 * API Endpoint: the install-wide folder permission model.
 * Actions: get, preview, set
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TWO DEFENSIBLE PHILOSOPHIES, NOT A SAFETY DIAL
 *
 *   containers  You must be able to read EVERY folder above a document. A locked
 *               cabinet is locked. (Default.)
 *   filing      Permissions live on documents; folders only organise. The
 *               nearest rules win and the ones above them do not apply.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT called strict/loose: that framing reads as secure/insecure,
 * so nobody would ever choose the second on its merits — and it IS a merit
 * choice. An MSP whose folders are filing wants the second; anyone with
 * confidential matters wants the first.
 *
 * ⚠️ INSTALL-WIDE, and it has to be.
 *   - NOT per folder: mixed models in one tree make "can Bob read this?" depend
 *     on which model each ancestor happens to be in, which nobody can answer in
 *     a support call.
 *   - NOT per company: articles with tenant_id IS NULL are SHARED with every
 *     company, so a per-company posture would make one document strict for one
 *     client and loose for another.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE HIGHEST-PRIVILEGE ACTION IN THE MODULE. It changes who can read
 * live documents with no per-document change to point at, so 'preview' exists to
 * say exactly how many documents move BEFORE anything is written, and the change
 * itself is audited.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
