 * Delete an integration connection.

 * ⚠️ Refuses while links still point at it. The alternative — cascading the
 * delete — would silently erase the record that ticket SD-1042 was raised in Jira
 * as OPS-412, and that reference has already been seen by people. Same principle
 * as merge, where a merged ticket is never deleted because its reference appears
 * in notifications somebody has read.
 *
 * The admin's route out is to switch the connection off, which keeps every link
 * readable but stops it being used. That is offered in the error rather than left
 * to be guessed at.
