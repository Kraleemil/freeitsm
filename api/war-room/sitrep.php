/**
 * API: War room — the situation report.
 *
 * POST JSON { since: '<HH:MM>'|'<hours>h', channel_id?: <int> }
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. During an incident somebody has to send an update to the
 * business every half hour, and they cannot read four hundred messages first.
 * This reads the chat since a time they choose and drafts the briefing: where
 * things stand, what changed, who is doing what, what is still unknown, and a
 * paragraph they could send as-is.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE IRONY IS ACKNOWLEDGED. The war room exists for when the internet is
 * down, and this is the one part of it that needs the internet. So it is strictly
 * additive: the chat never calls it, never waits for it, and does not degrade
 * without it. When the provider is unreachable this returns a plain "could not
 * reach the AI provider" and the room carries on exactly as before. That is also
 * why it is a panel you open rather than something on the page by default.
 *
 * 🔒 The transcript is scoped to the channels the CALLER can read, in SQL — so a
 * service delivery manager's summary can never quote a DM they are not in, which
 * would be a novel way to leak one.
