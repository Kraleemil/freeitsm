/**
 * API: War room — edit or delete one message.
 *
 * POST JSON { action: 'edit'|'delete', id: <int>, body?: "<text>" }
 *
 * WHO MAY DO WHAT, AND WHY THEY DIFFER:
 *
 *   edit    the AUTHOR only. Not an administrator, not the channel's creator.
 *           Nobody should be able to put words in somebody else's mouth in the
 *           record of an incident.
 *   delete  the author, OR somebody with war_room.manage. Removal is a different
 *           act from rewriting: the case for it is a pasted password or customer
 *           data, and waiting for the author to come back from lunch is not an
 *           acceptable answer to that.
 *
 * Both are recorded rather than silent — see warRoomEditMessage / warRoomDelete-
 * Message. The content of a deleted message really is destroyed; what survives is
 * the fact that it was removed, and by whom.
