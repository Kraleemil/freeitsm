/**
 * API: War room — fetch new messages, register presence, refresh the sidebar.
 *
 * GET  ?channel_id=<int>&since_id=<int>&read=<0|1>
 *   since_id = the newest id the caller already holds; 0 asks for the tail.
 *   read=1   = also mark the channel read up to the newest message returned.
 *
 * This one request does four jobs — messages, presence in, presence out, and the
 * channel list with its unread counts — because it is the request the page makes
 * every few seconds anyway. Separate endpoints would multiply the traffic during
 * exactly the incident the module exists for.
 *
 * POLLING, NOT SSE, deliberately. Apache + mod_php holds one process per open
 * connection, so thirty analysts each keeping an EventSource open would sit on
 * thirty workers indefinitely — during an incident, when the rest of the app is
 * busiest. A short poll is stateless and degrades gracefully.
