/**
 * D008 — War room health.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS MATTERS MORE THAN A HEALTH CHECK USUALLY DOES, because the war room is
 * a BREAK-GLASS feature. Every other module tells you it is broken the moment you
 * try to use it. This one gets opened for the first time during an incident, when
 * the usual chat is already down and nobody has any appetite for discovering that
 * the attachments folder is unwritable or that the all-hands channel was never
 * created. The entire value of this tool is that it can be run on a quiet
 * Tuesday.
 *
 * So it checks the things that fail SILENTLY:
 *   - a missing all-hands channel: the war room opens with nowhere to talk
 *   - a foreign key with the wrong delete rule: deleting one analyst quietly
 *     destroys the record of an incident, and nobody finds out until the review
 *   - an unwritable or unprotected attachments folder
 *   - files on disk with no row pointing at them (retention deletes rows; only
 *     the sweep deletes bytes)
 *   - Warbot's tools, which are the half that must work with no internet
 *
 * ⚠️ Unlike D007 this needs no probe row left behind: the end-to-end write test
 * runs inside a TRANSACTION and is rolled back. D007 could not do that because
 * MATCH...AGAINST cannot see uncommitted rows; nothing here has that problem, so
 * nothing here should flash up in somebody's open war room.
 *
 * Output: plain text, section-delimited with === HEADERS === for easy skimming.
