/**
 * How a task's priority is drawn — the one home for it.
 *
 * 🔴 The colour comes from `task_priorities.colour`, NEVER from the name.
 *
 * Every renderer used to build a CSS class out of the priority's display name
 * (`priority-dot ${t.priority.toLowerCase()}`) against four hardcoded English
 * rules — urgent / high / medium / low. Rename a priority, translate it, or add
 * a fifth, and the class matched nothing: the element still rendered, as an 8px
 * transparent circle. No error, no fallback, no dot. Reported from a German
 * install (discussion #108) where the priorities had been renamed to Hoch /
 * Mittel / Niedrig, which is the first thing a German admin would do.
 *
 * Same disease as GH #79, where every ticket intake path looked the starting
 * status up by the word 'Open' and a German site that had renamed it to Offen
 * got tickets with no status at all. The cure is the same: the display name is
 * the user's to change, so nothing may be derived from it.
 *
 * It was also wrong in English. The seeded colours and the CSS never agreed —
 * Low is configured #16a34a green in Settings and was drawn #999 grey — so the
 * swatch an admin picked was not the colour they got.
 *
 * Loaded by the board, timeline and table pages; keep it dependency-free so it
 * can sit ahead of any of them.
