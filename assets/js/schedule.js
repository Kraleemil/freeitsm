/**
 * Scheduling maths, shared by every screen that can schedule a ticket.
 *
 * There are now two: the inbox (its Schedule modal, reached from the ticket or
 * the right-click menu) and the tickets calendar (clicking an event). They must
 * agree exactly on what a duration means, what an all-day ticket is stored as,
 * and how a naive wall-clock value is parsed — so it is stated once here rather
 * than copied into both and left to drift. A third caller is coming when
 * scheduled work is pushed to Outlook.
 *
 * ⚠️ SCHEDULING VALUES ARE NAIVE WALL-CLOCK. "2pm" means 2pm to every analyst in
 * every timezone; they are stored without a zone and must never be round-tripped
 * through Date.toISOString(), which converts to UTC first and moved a 00:30
 * ticket to the previous DAY for anyone east of UTC (#1161).
