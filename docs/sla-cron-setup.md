# SLA Breach Notification Cron — Setup Guide

The SLA breach notification engine fires emails when tickets approach or exceed their
response / resolution SLA targets. Rules are configured under **Tickets → Settings → SLA →
Breach Notifications**, but the *trigger* is a scheduled task that runs the engine —
ideally every 5 minutes.

This document describes how to set up that schedule on Windows and Linux.

## What runs

A single PHP script: `cron/sla_breach_check.php`

It walks every open SLA-tracked ticket, decides whether each ticket's response /
resolution SLA has crossed the warning threshold or breached, finds the matching
notification rule, and sends emails via the ticket's originating mailbox (Microsoft
Graph or Gmail). De-duplication is automatic — once a notification has fired for a
given `(ticket, target, trigger)` it won't fire again.

Output is plain text — counts of sent / skipped / errors, plus one line per email
actually sent. Suitable for capturing in a Task Scheduler log or a cron-mailed report.

Recommended cadence: **every 5 minutes**. Frequent enough that breaches notify within
a useful window, sparse enough that you're not hammering the mailbox API.

## Two ways to invoke

### A. CLI (recommended)

`php c:\wamp64\www\freeitsm-app\cron\sla_breach_check.php`

No auth needed — filesystem permissions already gate who can run it.

### B. HTTP

`curl http://your-host/freeitsm-app/cron/sla_breach_check.php?token=<TOKEN>`

The token is auto-generated on first install and stored in `system_settings` under
the key `sla_cron_token`. Read it with:

```
php scripts/cron_token.php sla
```

> **Don't read the row directly.** `sla_cron_token` is encrypted at rest, so
> `SELECT setting_value FROM system_settings …` returns `ENC:…` rather than the token.
> Pasting that into the URL gets you a `403` from your own install. The command above
> decrypts it; `php scripts/cron_token.php --url` prints the whole URL ready to paste.

To rotate it, delete the row and run **Database Verification**, which seeds a fresh one
already encrypted:

```sql
DELETE FROM system_settings WHERE setting_key = 'sla_cron_token';
```

`UPDATE`-ing the row with a value of your own also works — the app reads plaintext and
ciphertext alike — but it leaves the token in cleartext until the next Database
Verification encrypts it again.

Use the HTTP form when you can't easily run PHP from the shell (some shared
hosting, or remote cron services like cron-job.org / EasyCron).

**Security layers on the HTTP form** (all enforced automatically):

1. **Shared-secret token** — 128 bits of entropy, compared with `hash_equals()`
   for constant-time matching.
2. **Per-IP failed-auth lockout** — >10 wrong-token attempts from the same IP
   in the past hour triggers a 1-hour 429 lockout. Defeats brute-force probing
   without needing fail2ban or similar.
3. **Min interval between successful runs** — `sla_cron_min_interval_seconds`
   in `system_settings` (default 30s). Even with a valid token, requests
   arriving sooner than this after the last successful run return 429. Defeats
   accidental double-scheduling, runaway loops, and post-token-leak abuse
   without affecting any reasonable schedule.

Every invocation (accepted or rejected) is logged to `sla_cron_runs`. Inspect
recent activity from the SLA settings tab ("Cron Activity" panel) or directly:

```sql
SELECT started_at, invocation, client_ip, outcome, sent_count, error_count, notes
  FROM sla_cron_runs
 ORDER BY started_at DESC
 LIMIT 20;
```

## Windows — Task Scheduler

Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`) and create a new task:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `FreeITSM — SLA Breach Check` |
| Run whether user is logged in or not | ✓ |
| Run with highest privileges | optional |
| Trigger | Daily, recur every **1 day**, repeat every **5 minutes** for **1 day** |
| Action | Start a program |
| Program/script | `C:\wamp64\bin\php\php8.2.x\php.exe` |
| Add arguments | `C:\wamp64\www\freeitsm-app\cron\sla_breach_check.php` |
| Start in | `C:\wamp64\www\freeitsm-app` |

(Adjust the PHP path to match your WAMP version — `C:\wamp64\bin\php\` lists what's installed.)

**Captured output**: Task Scheduler doesn't capture stdout by default. To log the
output, wrap the action in a tiny `.bat` file:

```bat
@echo off
"C:\wamp64\bin\php\php8.2.x\php.exe" "C:\wamp64\www\freeitsm-app\cron\sla_breach_check.php" >> "C:\wamp64\logs\sla_cron.log" 2>&1
```

…and point Task Scheduler at the `.bat` instead.

## Linux — cron

Add one line to your crontab (`crontab -e`):

```cron
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/freeitsm-app/cron/sla_breach_check.php >> /var/log/freeitsm-sla-cron.log 2>&1
```

Adjust the `php` binary path (`which php`) and the FreeITSM install path to match your install.

Make sure the cron user has read access to `config.php` (DB credentials) and the
PHP install has the required extensions (`pdo_mysql`, `curl`, `mbstring`).

---

## Remote / hosted schedulers (cron-job.org, EasyCron, etc.)

Use the HTTP invocation:

```
GET https://your-itsm.example.com/cron/sla_breach_check.php?token=<TOKEN>
```

Set the interval to 5 minutes. The endpoint returns HTTP 200 on success and 500 on
error so the scheduler can alert you to failures.

---

## Verifying it works

After setting up the schedule:

1. Make sure SLA enforcement is enabled (`Tickets → Settings → SLA → Enforce SLAs from`
   set to a past datetime).
2. Have at least one ticket with a priority that has SLA targets set, and a
   notification rule that matches.
3. Run the script manually once:
   ```
   php c:\wamp64\www\freeitsm-app\cron\sla_breach_check.php --verbose
   ```
4. Look at the output. It will tell you which tickets it considered, which rules
   matched, and what was sent / skipped / errored.

Common skips and what they mean:
- `SLA enforcement disabled` — set `sla_enforce_from`.
- `no matching rule` — add a default rule (scope = Default) so every department is covered.
- `rule matched but no resolvable recipients` — the rule's assignee/team/analyst checkboxes
  are on but the ticket has no assignee, or the team has no members with email addresses.

---

## What gets de-duplicated

The `sla_notifications_sent` table records one row per `(ticket_id, target_type, trigger_type)`.
This means:

- A ticket's response warning fires **once**, even if the cron runs every 5 minutes for hours.
- Same ticket can also fire a response breach (separate row) and resolution warning / breach
  (separate rows).
- If you re-open a closed ticket, the rows persist — re-opens won't re-fire notifications.
  Clear the rows manually if you want them to re-fire:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM sla_notifications_sent WHERE ticket_id = 12345;
  ```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Cron runs, output says "SLA enforcement disabled" | Set `Enforce SLAs from` in SLA settings |
| Cron runs, output says all tickets skipped with "no matching rule" | Add at least one default-scope rule |
| Cron runs, output says "rule matched but no resolvable recipients" | The rule's checkboxes don't yield any email addresses for these tickets — add explicit emails or a named analyst |
| HTTP invocation returns 503 with "Cron token not set" | Run `api/system/db_verify.php` to seed the token, or insert manually |
| HTTP invocation returns 403 | Token in URL doesn't match `sla_cron_token` in `system_settings` |
| HTTP invocation returns 429 "Rate limited" | A successful run completed less than `sla_cron_min_interval_seconds` ago (default 30s). Wait, or lower the setting |
| HTTP invocation returns 429 "Too many failed attempts" | This IP has hit >10 wrong-token attempts in the past hour. Wait 1 hour, or `DELETE FROM sla_cron_runs WHERE client_ip = '<ip>' AND outcome = 'auth_failed'` to clear |
| Emails not arriving | Check the originating mailbox is still authenticated (Tickets → Settings → Mailboxes); the cron uses the same OAuth tokens as inbound mail polling |

## Tuning settings

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `sla_cron_min_interval_seconds` | 30 | Minimum seconds between successful runs. Even a valid-token request gets a 429 if it arrives sooner |
| `sla_cron_log_retention_days` | 30 | How long to keep `sla_cron_runs` rows. Pruned automatically at end of every cron run |
| `sla_cron_token` | random per install | Shared secret for HTTP invocation. **Encrypted at rest** — read it with `php scripts/cron_token.php sla`, and rotate it by deleting the row and re-running Database Verification |

Edit via SQL:
```sql
UPDATE system_settings SET setting_value = '60' WHERE setting_key = 'sla_cron_min_interval_seconds';
```
