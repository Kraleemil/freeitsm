/**
 * Watchtower — settings manifest.
 *
 * Watchtower is the one module that owns no data: it reads every other module
 * and shows what needs attention. So its settings are entirely about the VIEW,
 * and neither capability here grants any access to the things being counted —
 * each card still shows only what the analyst is allowed to see.
 *
 * Why this screen exists at all, given the statuses are configured elsewhere:
 * "which statuses appear on my dashboard" is a fact about the dashboard, not
 * about the status. Statuses carry their own facts — is_closed, is_default —
 * which the SLA engine and half the application depend on, and mixing one
 * view's preferences into them would mean tuning Watchtower by touring three
 * other modules' settings screens.
 *
 * The two tabs are split because they answer different questions and carry
 * different risk. CARDS is layout: hide the Contracts card and you have tidied
 * a screen. COUNTS changes what a number MEANS — narrow "high priority" and the
 * figure everyone reads each morning silently changes definition — so it is
 * worth being able to grant the first without the second.
