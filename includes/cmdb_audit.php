/**
 * CMDB data-quality audit — "is this CMDB still telling you the truth?"
 *
 * A CMDB rots quietly. Nothing errors when a record goes stale, loses the field
 * that made it useful, or ends up connected to nothing; it simply stops being
 * worth opening, and by the time anyone notices, nobody trusts it. That is the
 * usual reason these modules get abandoned.
 *
 * The checks are deliberately framed around whether the data can still answer
 * the question the module exists to answer — what breaks if this breaks. A CI
 * connected to nothing is not a stylistic problem, it is a CI that can never
 * appear in anyone's blast radius.
 *
 * DESIGN
 * ------
 * Every check is derived from declarations that already exist — a property
 * marked required, a property ticked as a dependency, a relationship type set
 * to carry impact. There is no rule-builder and no new schema: the install has
 * already stated its intent, and the audit only reports where reality has
 * drifted from it. (iTop's equivalent lets you write the rules; that is a much
 * bigger feature and it can come later without breaking this one.)
 *
 * Findings are advisory. Nothing here edits, blocks or "fixes" anything — the
 * analyst is the one who knows whether a standalone CI is a mistake or simply a
 * standalone CI.
