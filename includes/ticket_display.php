/**
 * How a ticket's messages are displayed — the collapsing of long ones.
 *
 * From discussion #104: long email chains bury the thing you opened the ticket
 * to read. Same idea as Gmail's "···", and Zammad does it too.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 🔑 WHY HEIGHT AND NOT LINES
 *
 * The request asked for a line threshold, and measuring real inbound mail says
 * that is the wrong unit. On a live install: 122 inbound emails, averaging 8,337
 * characters of which only ~1,800 are visible text — 38 of them laid out with
 * `<table>` and 26 carrying their own `<style>`. A vendor notification like
 * "Your Microsoft invoice is ready" is 57,750 characters and a handful of source
 * lines, and renders about a metre tall.
 *
 * So the trigger is RENDERED HEIGHT, measured in the browser after the message
 * is laid out, which is the only number that corresponds to what somebody
 * actually has to scroll past. The SETTING is still expressed in lines, because
 * "collapse after about 12 lines" is a sentence an administrator can reason
 * about and "collapse after 260 pixels" is not — the conversion lives in one
 * place, below.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nothing here deletes anything. Collapsing is presentation: the full message
 * is in the page, one tap away, always. That matters because the quote-boundary
 * problem is genuinely hard (Mailgun's talon, the best-known solver, quotes
 * 98% on ordinary replies and names forwarded HTML as its weak spot) — and a
 * wrong boundary should cost a click, never a fact.

/**
 * The display settings, with defaults, in one place.
 *
 * Defaults chosen so an install that never opens the settings behaves sensibly
 * rather than surprisingly: collapsing ON (it is what was asked for), the newest
 * message always open (it is the one you came for), and the threshold generous
 * enough that ordinary human replies are never touched.
