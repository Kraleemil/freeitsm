/**
 * The provider registry — the ONE list adding a tracker touches at this layer.

 * `credential_fields` drives the settings form, so a provider whose auth looks

 * the form renders them. That is the difference between "adding GitHub is one
 * file" and "adding GitHub means editing the settings screen too".
 *
 * `url_hint` / `url_label` exist because "Site URL" means something different per
 * tracker and a wrong-shaped URL is the most likely setup mistake.
 *
 * `settings_fields` (optional) is for a NON-SECRET per-connection choice, and it
 * is deliberately a separate list from `credential_fields` rather than a `type`
 * on one. The two behave in opposite ways on an edit:
 *
 *   credential_fields — blanked when the form opens, and an empty box means
 *                       "keep the stored secret". Correct for a token; nobody
 *                       should be shown one they already saved.
 *   settings_fields   — shown WITH the current value and always submitted.
 *
 * Putting a dropdown in credential_fields would inherit the blanking rule, so
 * every save would quietly reset the choice back to its default — a silent
 * behaviour change nobody would connect to having pressed Save.
