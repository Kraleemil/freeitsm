/**
 * AzureDevOpsProvider — Azure DevOps Services (cloud) and Server (on-prem).
 *
 * ── Why this connector is shaped differently from Jira ───────────────────────
 *
 * Jira and Azure DevOps look alike from the outside and are genuinely different
 * underneath. The four differences that drive this file:
 *
 *   1. WRITES ARE JSON PATCH. Everything — create and update — is a
 *      `[{"op":"add","path":"/fields/System.Title","value":…}]` document sent as
 *      `application/json-patch+json`. There is no "post a fields object" call.
 *   2. TYPES AND STATES ARE PER-PROCESS, not per-project or global. Two projects
 *      in the SAME organisation can disagree about which work item types exist
 *      and what their states are called.
 *   3. BODIES ARE HTML, and which FIELD holds the body depends on the work item
 *      type — see bodyFieldFor().
 *   4. QUERYING IS TWO-STEP. WIQL returns ids only; the fields need a second
 *      batch read.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ Five state categories, not four ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Azure DevOps has Proposed / InProgress / **Resolved** / Completed / Removed.
 * We have four. `Resolved` — "the developer says it is fixed, but nobody has
 * verified it" — is the one that does not map cleanly, so it is a per-connection
 * setting rather than a decision baked in here. See mapStateCategory().
 *
 * ⚠️ Never branch on a state NAME. Azure DevOps proves why better than Jira did:
 * in the stock Agile process the state called **"Resolved" is category Resolved
 * on a Bug and category InProgress on a User Story** — the same word meaning
 * different things on two types in the same project.
 *
 * ── Testability ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * As with JiraProvider, payload building and response parsing are separate
 * protected methods so the interesting logic is provable without a live
 * organisation. tests/integrations stubs httpRequest().
