/**
 * Pull readable text out of an attachment — the dependency-free tier
 * (discussion #53, tier 1 of the wiki's §8.2).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * ----------------------------------
 * No PDFs, no legacy .doc/.xls, no OCR. Those need a real parser, and a real
 * parser has no business running inside the web request:
 *
 *   - The input is HOSTILE. An attachment arrives from anyone who can email the
 *     service desk, through api/tickets/check_mailbox_email.php, which has no
 *     authentication at all. Malformed documents are a well-trodden route to
 *     remote code execution, and this process holds the database credentials.
 *   - FreeITSM has no Composer, so a PHP PDF library would be vendored by hand
 *     and ours to patch for its lifetime. A bundled library version was itself
 *     a finding in the August 2026 security review.
 *
 * Those formats are tier 2: one external extractor, in a container, reached over
 * HTTP — see includes/search/tika.php. Until an install configures one they are
 * recorded as `unsupported`, which is
 * the honest answer rather than silence.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES HANDLE, AND WHY IT NEEDS NOTHING
 * ---------------------------------------------
 *   .txt .csv .log .md .json .xml   already text; read it
 *   .docx .xlsx .pptx               a ZIP of XML. ZipArchive + strip tags.
 *                                   includes/rfp_docx_parser.php has done this
 *                                   since the RFP builder; no library involved.
 *
 * ⚠️ The RFP parser is NOT reused as-is. It was written for documents chosen and
 * uploaded by a signed-in member of staff; these arrive from strangers. Same
 * file format, completely different threat model — hence the zip-bomb guards
 * below, which that parser has no reason to carry.
