/**
 * Getting attached documents into search (discussion #76).
 *
 * 🔑 WHY THIS IS NOT PART OF THE ATTACHMENT QUEUE. Email attachments already have
 * an extraction pipeline, and it looks reusable until you read what it does with
 * the result: it walks attachment → email → TICKET and re-indexes the whole
 * ticket, because an attachment's text belongs to the ticket's corpus row. An
 * attached document has no ticket. It is its own row, whose visibility comes from
 * whatever it is attached to.
 *
 * So the two pipelines share the part that is genuinely the same — the extractor,
 * attTextExtractFile(), which takes a path and gives back text — and keep their
 * own queues, because "what do I do once I have the text" is a different answer.
 * A single table would also have needed a composite primary key, since a document
 * id and an email-attachment id are both small integers from different tables.
 *
 * ⚠️ A LINK CANNOT BE INDEXED. There is no document, only a URL. A linked
 * document is findable by its title and description and nothing else, which
 * quietly makes the description field load-bearing — worth saying in the UI
 * rather than labelling it "optional".
 *
 * ⚠️ CONFIGURED IS NOT AVAILABLE. A file whose extractor is unreachable stays
 * `pending` and is retried; it never becomes `failed`. That distinction is the
 * whole reason a stuck queue is visible instead of looking like an empty one.
