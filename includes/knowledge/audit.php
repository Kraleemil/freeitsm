/**
 * The Knowledge history — the ONE place a row is written.
 *
 * Four files had grown their own copy of the same INSERT before this existed
 * (folders.php, permissions.php, permission_model.php, visibility.php), which is
 * the same duplication the visibility clause suffered from: nothing breaks when
 * the copies drift, one of them just quietly starts recording something slightly
 * different — and an audit trail that disagrees with itself is worse than none,
 * because it is trusted.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * BEST EFFORT, ALWAYS
 * An unwritable log must never fail the thing being logged. Refusing to save an
 * article because its history row would not write is a worse outcome than a gap
 * in the history — but the gap is logged to error_log, because a silently
 * unwritable audit table is the one failure nobody would ever notice.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠️ VIEWS ARE A DIFFERENT VOLUME CLASS FROM EVERYTHING ELSE
 * knowledge_articles.view_count already counts every read. A row per view on a
 * busy knowledge base is millions a year, and the rows people actually come
 * looking for — who changed the permissions, who deleted it — would be buried
 * under them within a month.
 *
 * So a view is recorded ONCE PER PERSON PER ARTICLE PER DAY. That keeps the
 * question worth asking ("who has read this?") answerable, while a hundred
 * re-reads by the same analyst in an afternoon stay one row. The total count is
 * still exact, because it comes from view_count and never from here.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
