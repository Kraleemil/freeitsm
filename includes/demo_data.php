 * ones, and the demo data page, to say whether a module has been imported.
 * They used to answer it separately, and the second answer was wrong — it
 * asked "does this table have ANY rows?", so an installation with real tickets
 * or real assets was reported as already having the demo data. Same family of
 * fault as the importer's own: nothing distinguished demo rows from real ones.

 * The distinguishing mark is now the `is_demo` column, set on every row the
 * importer inserts and present on all of the tables listed here.
