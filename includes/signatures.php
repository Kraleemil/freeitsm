/**
 * Analyst email signatures (discussion #80, request 3).
 *
 * WHY THE MERGE CODES ARE NOT THE ONES YOU ALREADY KNOW
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️ `[analyst_name]` is NOT the person typing. buildTicketMergeData() resolves it
 * from the ticket:
 *
 *      COALESCE(o.full_name, a.full_name)     -- o = owner, a = assigned analyst
 *
 * which is the right answer for an automatic email about a ticket, and the wrong
 * answer for a signature. Sam answering a ticket owned by Jo would sign it *Jo* —
 * every time, to the customer, without either of them noticing.
 *
 * So signatures get their own vocabulary, tied to whoever is signed in: `[my_name]`,
 * `[my_email]`, `[my_job_title]` and so on. The `my_` prefix is not decoration; it is
 * the whole distinction, and it reads correctly next to the My Account screen these
 * are edited on. The ticket codes keep meaning exactly what they always meant.
 *
 * ESCAPING
 * --------
 * Same rule as canned responses: the BODY is trusted (the analyst wrote it, and it is
 * HTML on purpose so a signature can have a link or bold text), the VALUES substituted
 * into it are not. An analyst's own job title is hardly hostile, but it is typed into
 * a box and ends up in somebody else's inbox, so it is escaped like anything else.

/**
 * The values a signature can merge, for the analyst who is signing.
