/**
 * Saved table views (discussion #96, dschipfel; library and sharing by Ed).
 *
 * A view is a saved way of LOOKING at a table: which columns, in what order,
 * sorted how, filtered to what. It belongs to the shared data-table engine
 * (assets/js/data-table.js), so every table running that engine gets views for
 * free — assets, tasks, calendar and change management today.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY read goes through viewVisibleClause(). One place decides who can see
 * what, because there are three answers (mine, my team's, everyone's) and a
 * fourth that must never happen (somebody else's private view). Four endpoints
 * each writing their own clause is four chances to get that wrong.
 *
 * 🔑 A view is not data. It carries no tenant_id and needs none: its filters are
 * applied to rows the reader was already allowed to load, so a shared view
 * cannot show anybody another company's assets. It can name a value that means
 * nothing to the reader, which shows up as a filter matching nothing — an empty
 * table, not a leak.
