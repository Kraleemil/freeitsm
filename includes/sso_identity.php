/**
 * Sign-in identity links — the one home for the (provider, subject) → account

 * `analyst_sso_identities` and `user_sso_identities` record which directory or
 * identity-provider identity belongs to which FreeITSM account. OIDC writes and
 * reads them (api/auth/oidc_callback.php) and so does LDAP/AD (includes/ldap.php),
 * and both resolve a person the same way: existing link → email match →
 * just-in-time create. The link lookup runs FIRST in all four branches, which is
 * why the dangling-link case below had to be fixed in one place rather than four.

/**
 * Drop a sign-in link whose account no longer exists.
 *
 * A link can outlive the account it points at. Both identity tables declare
 * ON DELETE CASCADE, but anything that deletes rows with FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS
 * off bypasses the cascade — the demo data importer used to do exactly that
 * when it emptied `analysts` and `users` (#1297) — and the link is left behind,
 * pointing at an id that is gone.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic leftover. Every sign-in path looks a person up by
 * (provider, subject) FIRST, so a dangling link WINS that lookup, and email
 * matching and just-in-time provisioning both live in the branch past it. The
 * person is locked out permanently, and re-creating their account by hand does
 * not help, because the link still points at the old id. It happened to a real
 * user, and the message he saw ("Your account is no longer available") named
 * nothing he could act on.
 *
 * Clearing the link puts them back on the path a first-time sign-in takes, with
 * the same verified-email and provider-assignment checks — no account becomes
 * reachable that a first-time user could not already reach. Deleting an account
 * through the interface already cascades the link away and already allows
 * just-in-time re-creation, so this adds no new exposure.
 *
 * $table is a caller-supplied literal and is checked against a fixed list; it
 * never comes from request input.
