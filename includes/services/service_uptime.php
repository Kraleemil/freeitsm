/**
 * Service history and uptime, DERIVED from incidents (discussion #59).
 *
 * ── Why there is nothing to "log" ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The request was for a table recording every status change per service. There
 * is no such thing to record: `status_services` has no status column. A
 * service's status is computed live in get_dashboard.php as
 *
 *     the worst impact level among its OPEN incidents, else 'Operational'
 *
 * so a history table of previous → new would sit permanently empty.
 *
 * What already exists is better. Every period a service was not Operational IS
 * an incident that touched it:
 *
 *     start   status_incidents.created_datetime
 *     end     status_incidents.resolved_datetime  (or now, if still open)
 *     what    status_incident_services.impact_level_id
 *
 * So the history can be derived from data every install already has, which
 * means it works RETROSPECTIVELY on outages that have already happened rather
 * than shipping empty and becoming useful in six months.
 *
 * ── What this deliberately cannot see yet ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ Changes DURING an incident. `replaceIncidentServices()` deletes and
 * re-inserts the service links, so moving a service from Major Outage to
 * Degraded mid-incident overwrites the earlier value — this will report the
 * whole incident at whatever the level ended up as. Incident status transitions
 * (Investigating → Identified → Monitoring) are not timestamped either.
 *
 * That is the phase-two work: one incident-updates log, written where incidents
 * are saved, which this function would then read in preference to the
 * incident's own start/end. Until then every figure here is "per incident"
 * rather than "per change", and the UI says so rather than implying a precision
 * it does not have.
