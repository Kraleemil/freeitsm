/**
 * SlackProvider — Slack as a messaging channel, via a Slack app the CUSTOMER owns.
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT an "integration provider" in the Jira / Azure DevOps sense.
 * Slack has no work items and no states, so none of that engine applies. It is a
 * conversation channel, exactly like WhatsApp and web chat, and it rides the same
 * MessagingProvider contract: verify the webhook, parse an inbound message, send a
 * reply, download a file.
 *
 * ── BRING YOUR OWN APP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no FreeITSM-hosted Slack app and there never will be. Publishing one
 * would mean we host the OAuth redirect and every install's events flow through
 * our server — permanent infrastructure, and we would become a data processor for
 * other people's companies. Instead the customer creates an app in their own
 * workspace from the manifest we generate (slack_manifest.php), and their Slack
 * talks straight to their FreeITSM. Nothing touches us.
 *
 * Credentials JSON (messaging_channels.credentials, encrypted at rest):
 *   {
 *     "bot_token":      "xoxb-…",   // Bot User OAuth Token
 *     "signing_secret": "…",        // Basic Information → Signing Secret
 *     "watch_channel":  "C08ABCDE"  // optional: only ingest from this channel
 *   }
 * messaging_channels.channel_ref holds the Slack team (workspace) id.
 *
 * Inbound: Slack POSTs Events API JSON. Authenticity is the v0 signature — see
 * verifyWebhook, which also enforces the replay window Slack requires.

     * Slack's url_verification handshake: echo back the challenge.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE SETUP DEADLOCK, and why this is allowed through unsigned.
     *
     * Slack verifies the request URL the instant the app is created from the
     * manifest. But the signing secret does not exist until the app exists — so
     * at that moment FreeITSM cannot possibly hold it. Requiring a valid
     * signature here therefore makes setup impossible, not merely awkward:
     *
     *     create the app  →  Slack POSTs the challenge  →  403 (no secret yet)
     *     →  Slack refuses the URL  →  you never get the secret  →  ↺
     *
     * Found by actually doing it, not by testing: every unit test passed.
     *
     * So the handshake is answered without a signature ONLY while the channel
     * has no signing secret — the setup window, which lasts minutes. Once the
     * secret is stored the endpoint verifies this like anything else.
     *
     * What this does NOT open up: a real message. `event_callback` always
     * requires a valid signature, secret or no secret, so nothing can be
     * injected into the ticket system through the gap. The worst an outsider can
     * do is learn that a FreeITSM install answers at a URL they already knew.
