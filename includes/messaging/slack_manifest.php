/**
 * The Slack app manifest for THIS install.
 *
 * FreeITSM does not publish a Slack app. There is no "Add to Slack" button and
 * no FreeITSM-hosted OAuth service, deliberately: publishing one would mean this
 * project ran a server that every customer's Slack traffic passed through,
 * forever, and became a data processor for other people's companies. Instead the
 * customer creates an app in their own workspace, and it talks straight to their
 * own FreeITSM.
 *
 * A manifest turns that from a page of instructions into one paste. Slack's
 * "Create an app → From a manifest" flow takes this JSON and sets the name,
 * scopes, event subscriptions and request URL in one go — so nobody has to hunt
 * through the Slack UI ticking permission boxes, which is where this kind of
 * setup normally goes wrong.
 *
 * ⚠️ The request URL is baked in per channel, because the webhook endpoint is
 * per-channel (`webhook.php?channel=<id>`). So the manifest can only be built
 * AFTER the channel row exists — which is why the settings page saves first and
 * offers the manifest second.

 * Notably absent: channels:manage (creating channels), users:write, and
 * anything touching files:write. Those belong to features we have not built.
