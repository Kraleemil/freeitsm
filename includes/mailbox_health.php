/**
 * Mailbox health — everything that could be quietly wrong with a mailbox.
 *
 * Built for #79, where a mailbox collected mail perfectly well but stamped no
 * origin on the tickets it opened. Nothing was broken enough to error, so
 * nothing said anything: the mailbox list showed a green "Authenticated" badge
 * and the fault only surfaced weeks later, on the tickets.
 *
 * So the rule here is that a mailbox can be CONNECTED and still not be doing
 * what you think it is. Each check names one specific thing and says what the
 * consequence is, because "there is a problem" that doesn't say which problem
 * is barely better than silence.
 *
 * Severity:
 *   'error'   — mail is not being collected, or is being collected wrongly.
 *   'warning' — mail is collected, but something downstream is not set up.
 *
 * Pure function of a row already loaded by get_mailboxes.php (plus a couple of
 * looked-up extras), so it can't itself be the thing that breaks the list.
 */

/**
 * Every warning here can be dismissed, because every one of them can legitimately
 * be somebody's deliberate choice: a mailbox that genuinely should record no
 * origin, a receive-only IMAP mailbox with no outgoing server, a low-traffic
 * mailbox nobody minds being checked rarely. Dismissing says "I know", and the
 * item drops out of the ! while staying visible, and reversible, inside it.
 *
 * Errors cannot be dismissed. Reading the wrong inbox or holding credentials
 * that no longer decrypt is not a configuration choice, it is a fault, and
 * letting somebody silence it would be the one case where this whole feature
 * makes things worse than saying nothing.
