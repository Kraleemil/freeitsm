/**
 * Reading a whole ticket with an AI: the shared parts.
 *
 * Two features from discussion #104 sit on this file:
 *
 *   • The MAINTAINED SUMMARY (idea 7) — a few lines at the top of the ticket
 *     saying where things stand, rewritten when the conversation moves on.
 *   • READ THIS TICKET FOR ME (idea 12) — an on-demand briefing you ask for and
 *     read once, stored nowhere.
 *
 * They share one thing worth having in a single place: turning a ticket into the
 * text a model actually sees. Getting that wrong is how a summary quotes an
 * internal note into something customer-facing, or costs ten times what it
 * should because nobody bounded the transcript.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠️ WHAT A SUMMARY IS NOT
 *
 * It is not the ticket. The conversation stays exactly where it was, in full,
 * underneath — the summary is an extra pane you can collapse, never a
 * replacement for reading. That matters more here than anywhere else in
 * FreeITSM, because this is the one feature that could quietly become the only
 * thing anybody reads. So it is always labelled as machine-written, always
 * carries the time it was written and what it read, and always says when the
 * conversation has moved on since.
 *
 * 🔑 AND IT IS NEVER OVERWRITTEN. A refresh writes a new version; every earlier
 * one stays readable. A later reading really can be worse than an earlier one —
 * a model changes underneath you, a thread grows past what fits — and without
 * history that loss is silent and permanent.
