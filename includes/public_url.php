/**
 * Where is this installation reachable from, seen from outside?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
 * ----------------------
 * BASE_URL answers "where does the app live under the web root" and nothing more.
 * It is a path — `/freeitsm-app/` — which is the right and sufficient answer for
 * every link on a page FreeITSM itself renders, because the browser already knows
 * the host.
 *
 * It is the wrong answer for a link FreeITSM *sends somewhere else*: an email, a
 * Jira issue, a Slack message. There the reader's browser resolves the address
 * against whatever host they happen to be on, and a bare path 404s.
 *
 * THE CASE THIS IS REALLY FOR: THERE IS NO REQUEST
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious fix — read the host off the current request — works for the analyst
 * who clicked something, and fails for everything unattended. Mail collected by
 * cron, an SLA breach notification, a workflow escalation: no request exists, so
 * $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] is simply absent. **Unattended is the normal case for
 * outbound mail, not the exception**, which is why an explicitly configured
 * address has to come first and cannot merely be a fallback.
 *
 * WHY IT MOVED HERE
 * -----------------
 * This logic was written for issue trackers and lived in integrations.php, where
 * `integrationsAbsoluteUrl()` still is — it now calls this. The [ticket_url] merge
 * code (discussion #80) needs precisely the same answer, and a second copy of
 * "how do I address this install" is exactly the kind of duplication that drifts:
 * one of them would get the reverse-proxy handling and the other would not.
 * `includes/csat.php` and `includes/self_service_email.php` each still build their
 * own; they are older, they only ever run in request context, and folding them in
 * is a separate job with its own testing.
 */

/**
 * The address an administrator has explicitly configured, or '' if none.
 *
 * Separate from publicBaseUrl() on purpose: the UI needs to distinguish "nothing is
 * set, so a link sent from cron will be broken" from "something is set". Those are
 * different facts and only this function can tell them apart — publicBaseUrl()
 * always returns *something*, which is what makes it safe to build a link with and
 * useless for deciding whether to warn.
 *
 * `messaging_public_base_url` is read as a fallback because it already holds exactly
 * this fact on installs that configured web chat; `public_base_url` is preferred so
 * the general setting supersedes it without needing a migration.

 * Make sure the configured address carries the app's sub-path exactly once.

 * any path, because messagingWebhookUrl() adds the app root itself. `public_base_url`
 * is the whole root, sub-path included, because that is the natural thing to type
 * and what the integrations code has always appended paths to directly.
 *
 * Left alone, an install at `https://example.com/freeitsm-app` that had only ever
 * configured the messaging setting would get `https://example.com/self-service/...`
 * — a link to a page that is not there. Appending unconditionally instead gives
 * `.../freeitsm-app/freeitsm-app/...` for anyone who typed the sub-path in. So the
 * sub-path is added only when it is not already on the end, which is the same guard
 * messagingWebhookUrl() arrived at for the same reason.
