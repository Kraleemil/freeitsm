<?php
/**
 * The baseline impact level — "nothing is wrong with this service right now".
 *
 * A service with no open incident has no row in status_incident_services, so its
 * status is not stored anywhere; it is derived. That derived value used to be the
 * hardcoded string 'Operational' in six separate places (GH #70). Rename the level
 * on Service status → Settings → Impact levels and every one of them kept saying
 * "Operational" — a name that no longer matched any row, so the badge also lost
 * its colour, while a service that WAS in an incident showed the new name
 * correctly. Two services, two different names for the same level.
 *
 * service_impact_levels.is_default is the flag that already means "baseline":
 * saving one clears the rest, deleting it is refused, and if the table somehow
 * ends up with none, the least severe level is promoted. So resolve the fallback
 * from that row rather than from a literal, and hand back its colour too — the
 * callers need the badge colour for a level that is renamed OR deactivated.
 *
 * No dependencies beyond PDO, deliberately: the self-service portal dashboard
 * needs this and should not have to pull in the workflow engine to get it.
