/**
 * Ticket lifecycle events — the one place `ticket.created` is announced from.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * `ticket.created` used to be dispatched from exactly one place,
 * TicketsService::create(), which is the ANALYST path. The other two ways a
 * ticket comes into existence both write their own raw INSERT and never went
 * near that service:
 *
 *   - api/self-service/create_ticket.php   (the self-service portal)
 *   - api/tickets/check_mailbox_email.php  (inbound email)
 *
 * So on a real service desk, where most tickets arrive by email or through the
 * portal, the event fired for a minority of tickets. Everything downstream
 * inherited that blind spot: workflows with a `ticket.created` trigger never
 * ran for those channels, and the notification bell never saw them either.
 *
 * Rather than add a third and fourth copy of the payload — which would drift —
 * the payload is built here, once, from the stored row. Every caller gets the
 * same shape, so a workflow condition on `ticket.department_id` means the same
 * thing regardless of how the ticket arrived.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two fields cannot come from the row, because they are facts about the ACT
 * of creating rather than about the ticket, and they legitimately differ per
 * channel. They are passed in:
 *
 *   $createdBy       analyst id, portal user id, or null for inbound email
 *                    (nobody signed in created it)
 *   $requesterEmail  supplied where the caller already knows it; otherwise
 *                    resolved from the linked user

/**
 * Announce that a ticket has been created.
 *
 * Safe to call from anywhere: it never throws. A failure to announce must not
 * cost somebody their ticket, which is the same rule every existing dispatch
 * call site already applies with its own try/catch.
 *
 * @param int         $ticketId       the ticket that now exists
 * @param int|null    $createdBy      who performed the creation, if anyone
 * @param string|null $requesterEmail overrides the address resolved from user_id
