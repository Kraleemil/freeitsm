/**
 * Assets covered by a contract (discussion #106, dschipfel).
 *
 * Both directions of one link: which equipment a contract covers, and which
 * contracts cover a piece of equipment. A mobile service agreement and the
 * handsets and SIMs on it is the worked example from the request.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN FOUR ENDPOINTS DOING IT THEMSELVES.
 * Assets are company-scoped and contracts are NOT — contracts have no
 * tenant_id at all. So the asset is the only side of the link that can answer
 * "whose is this?", and every read of the asset side has to be filtered to the
 * companies the analyst can reach. Four endpoints filtering separately is four
 * chances to forget; forgetting once puts one customer's equipment on another
 * customer's contract page, and it looks exactly like a working feature.
 *
 * 🔑 A scoped list is not a gate. `contractAssetCanReach()` is called again on
 * every write and every delete, because the id in a POST body did not
 * necessarily come from the list we rendered.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO HIDDEN COUNT. When a contract covers ten assets and the reader may see
 * three, they are shown three and told nothing about the other seven. A count
 * of what you cannot see is a leak of its own, and this is the mistake the
 * requester picker made: it scoped the list and not the count.
