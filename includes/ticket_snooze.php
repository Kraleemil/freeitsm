/**
 * Snoozing a ticket — "I can't do anything with this until Thursday."
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Half of a service desk's queue at any moment is waiting on somebody else: the
 * user who hasn't sent the screenshot, the supplier who ships on Tuesday, the
 * change that goes in at the weekend. Those tickets are not work — but they sit
 * in the inbox looking exactly like work, so an analyst re-reads them every
 * morning to re-decide they still can't be touched. Snoozing takes the ticket
 * out of the queue and brings it back at the moment it becomes actionable.
 *
 * WAKING IS THE CLOCK, NOT A CRON
 * -------------------------------
 * A snoozed ticket is defined as `snoozed_until > UTC_TIMESTAMP()` and nothing
 * else. Every list, count and badge tests that expression, so a ticket comes
 * back the instant its time passes whether or not anything is scheduled to run.
 * This is deliberate: an install with the crons switched off (or a box that was
 * asleep) must never leave a ticket buried past its wake time. The columns are
 * left holding a past value once it expires — harmless, and it means the audit
 * trail keeps the record of what was asked for.
 *
 * SNOOZE IS ON THE TICKET, NOT ON THE ANALYST
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Gmail-style snooze is personal, because an email belongs to one person. A
 * ticket doesn't: "waiting on the user until Thursday" is a fact about the
 * ticket, true for everyone who looks at it. So it sleeps for the whole desk,
 * and the banner names who put it to sleep and why, which is the information a
 * colleague needs when they wonder where it went.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 * -------------------
 * It does not touch SLA. The clock keeps running on a sleeping ticket, because
 * the customer's target is not suspended by the desk deciding to look away —
 * pausing it here would let a queue hit 100% by snoozing its way out of trouble.
 * It does not change status, and it does not hide the ticket from search.
