/**
 * MFA attempt throttling that survives the attacker throwing the session away.
 *
 * ── The bug this exists to close (S6, reported by Erlend Volden) ──────────────
 *
 * The MFA code step counted its failures in $_SESSION. The session is the one
 * piece of state the person guessing controls completely, so the counter was
 * advisory: five wrong codes abandoned the challenge, the attacker dropped the
 * cookie, presented the password again, and got five fresh guesses.
 *
 * The original code argued that this was acceptable because re-presenting the
 * password puts you back on a path protected by account lockout and the IP ban.
 * That argument was wrong for one specific reason, and it is worth stating
 * plainly because it is the kind of thing that reads as safe:
 *
 *     A SUCCESSFUL password step RESETS failed_login_count and locked_until
 *     (auth/login.php). An attacker who already holds a valid password never
 *     trips account lockout at all — every loop begins with a success.
 *
 * So the cost of unlimited guesses at a six-digit code was one extra request per
 * five attempts. A million codes is a weekend, not a wall.
 *
 * ── What this does instead ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The count lives on the account row, where the person guessing cannot reach it,
 * and NOTHING on the password path clears it. Only entering a correct code does.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SESSION COUNTER IS DELIBERATELY LEFT IN PLACE ALONGSIDE THIS. It is not
 * redundant and it is not dead code: it abandons the challenge cheaply for the
 * ordinary case, and — more importantly — it is what still protects an install
 * whose database has not been migrated yet (see the degrade rule below). Two
 * counters, different weaknesses, neither trusted alone.
 *
 * ── The degrade rule, and why it goes this way ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * If mfa_failed_count / mfa_locked_until are missing (an install that has not run
 * Database Verification since this shipped), every function here degrades to
 * "no opinion" and logs once. It does NOT fail closed.
 *
 * Failing closed here would refuse every MFA code on the install until an
 * administrator ran a migration — locking out exactly the security-conscious
 * users who enabled MFA, with no way back in. That is a worse outcome than
 * reverting to the session counter, which is what the app did until today.
 * Fail-closed is right for a data-access guard; it is wrong for the lock on the
 * front door.
