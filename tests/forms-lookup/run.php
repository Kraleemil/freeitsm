/**
 * Forms — lookup fields: scoping, portal gates, and field-type drift.
 *
 * A lookup field answers "which one?" by searching records the app already
 * holds. That makes it the first form field whose list of possible answers is
 * built at answer time out of live, company-scoped data — so two things can go
 * wrong that no previous field type could:
 *
 *  1. SCOPING. The search must never return a record the person asking is not
 *     allowed to see. A form is a place where a customer types, so "the widget
 *     only shows their own kit" has to be true on the server, not in the UI.
 *
 *  2. TAMPERING. The posted answer is an id. Nothing stops a crafted request
 *     naming someone else's asset, and if we accepted it the submission would
 *     render that asset's name to an analyst who would reasonably believe it.
 *     The submit-time guard is the generalisation of the older rule that a
 *     dropdown must be answered with one of ITS OWN choices.
 *
 * And one thing that has bitten this module before:
 *
 *  3. DRIFT. A field type has to be added in several places at once — the
 *     service whitelist, the AI generator's whitelist AND its prompt, the
 *     shared JS evaluator, the builder. The prompt is prose, so nothing fails
 *     when it falls behind; it just quietly stops offering the type, or offers
 *     one that no longer exists. This suite reads all five and compares them.
 *
 *   php tests/forms-lookup/run.php
 *
 * ⚠️ Every "it refused" assertion is paired with a positive control that the
 * same call ACCEPTS something legitimate. A function that refuses everything —
 * because a column name is wrong, say — would otherwise look like a clean pass.
 *
 * Read-only: it searches existing records and never writes.
