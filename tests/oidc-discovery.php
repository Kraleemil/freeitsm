/**
 * OIDC discovery endpoint validation (GH issue #117).
 *
 * The assertion that matters is not "a good discovery document is accepted".
 * It is that a BAD one is refused HERE, where we still know whose fault it is.
 *
 * A provider that publishes `authorization_endpoint` as a bare path
 * ("/oidc/authorize" instead of "https://idp.example.com/oidc/authorize") used
 * to be passed straight through. oidcBuildAuthUrl() then produced a relative
 * `Location:` header, and the BROWSER resolved it against the current origin —
 * this application. The user landed on OUR host, got a 404, and every visible
 * symptom pointed at FreeITSM. That is exactly how #117 was reported to us.
 *
 * So the tests below are mostly negative cases, and the positive controls are
 * there to prove the guard is not simply refusing everything.
 *
 * ⚠️ Touches no database and makes no network calls — oidcIsAbsoluteHttpUrl()
 * is a pure function, which is precisely why it is the thing worth testing.
 *
 * Run:  php tests/oidc-discovery.php
