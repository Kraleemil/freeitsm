/**
 * mailboxResolveFolderId() — reading mail from a folder that is not Inbox (GH #77).
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. `/mailFolders/<x>/messages` does not take folder NAMES.
 * Graph accepts a short list of well-known aliases there and treats everything
 * else as an opaque folder id, so a mailbox told to read "freeitsm" got:
 *
 *     400  ErrorInvalidIdMalformed — "Id is malformed."
 *
 * "INBOX" had always worked purely because it is on the alias list. Reading a
 * folder by name had never worked for any name off it.
 *
 * The resolver takes its HTTP fetcher as an argument, so the whole thing is
 * exercised here against a fixture with no network and no mailbox. What this
 * canNOT prove is what Graph really returns — see tests/integrations for that.
 *
 * Run:  php tests/mailbox-folder-resolve.php
