/**
 * Every workflow starter recipe must actually be runnable.
 *
 * `workflow/includes/templates.php` promises in its own header that "every
 * trigger_event here is a real, wired trigger … and every action type is a real
 * handler — a recipe that can't actually run would be worse than no recipe at
 * all". Nothing enforced that, and the first tracker recipe shipped with an
 * `add_note` action that does not exist (it is `add_ticket_note`). This does
 * enforce it.
 *
 *   php tests/integrations/templates_check.php
 *
 * ⚠️ SEPARATE FROM run.php ON PURPOSE. `WorkflowEngine::availableActions()`
 * reads webhook formats from the database, and run.php's value is that it needs
 * no database and no network. Do not merge this back into it.
 *
 * Checks, for EVERY template, not just the tracker ones:
 *   1. the trigger exists
 *   2. every action type exists
 *   3. every arg name exists on that action
 *   4. every required arg is supplied (or is a $configure marker the user fills)
 *   5. it resolves against THIS install without throwing
