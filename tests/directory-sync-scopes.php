/**
 * Directory sync — which parts of the directory are in scope.
 *
 *   php tests/directory-sync-scopes.php
 *
 * Pure logic, no fixture and no database: this is the arithmetic that decides
 * who gets imported, and it is worth being able to check it on any machine
 * without starting a directory.
 *
 * Two rules earn most of these cases:
 *
 *  1. A ticked branch means the whole branch, so being "under" something is
 *     decided by DN suffix — and the comma in that suffix is load-bearing.
 *     Without it OU=Sales matches OU=WholesaleSales and a carve-out silently
 *     swallows an unrelated department.
 *
 *  2. An install upgraded from before the OU browser has neither column set,
 *     and MUST go on importing exactly who it imported yesterday. The fallback
 *     is not a nicety — without it, upgrading imports nobody, and the sanity
 *     brake is then the only thing standing between that and every person in
 *     the company being marked as having left.
