/**
 * The Knowledge assistant must not judge one company's tickets "already covered"
 * by another company's articles.
 *
 * gapWindowSql() has always company-scoped the TICKET side. The article side was
 * a bare `SELECT ... FROM knowledge_articles WHERE is_published = 1 ...` with no
 * tenant filter at all, so the two halves of the same comparison disagreed about
 * whose data was in scope.
 *
 * WHAT THAT ACTUALLY BROKE — worth being exact, because the obvious guess is
 * wrong. The matched id lands in `knowledge_gap_tickets.best_article_id`, which
 * NOTHING reads, and the article title shown by api/knowledge/gap_clusters.php
 * comes from `knowledge_gap_clusters.article_id` — the article WRITTEN FROM a
 * cluster, not the best match. No foreign title was ever displayed.
 *
 * The real damage is quieter and worse. A ticket scoring above the article bar is
 * dropped from the candidate list and can never become a gap. Scoring against
 * articles the company cannot see therefore made the assistant SILENTLY
 * UNDER-REPORT: real gaps vanished, with no error, no warning, and an "everything
 * is covered" message that reads like good news. The feature exists to say what
 * is missing.
 *
 * Runs entirely inside ONE transaction that is ALWAYS rolled back, and in
 * "wording" mode so it needs no OpenAI key and spends nothing.
 *
 *   php tests/knowledge-visibility/06_gap_analysis.php
 *
 * ⚠️ Every negative assertion is paired with a POSITIVE CONTROL. "It did not match
 * the other company's article" is equally true of a harness that matched nothing
 * at all — so the same fixture proves that an article the analyst CAN see is
 * still matched, and that a SHARED one still is too.
