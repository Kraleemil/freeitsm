/**
 * Task priority indicators (GH discussion #108).
 *
 * This is a SCAN, not a behaviour test, and deliberately so.
 *
 * The bug it guards against is not a wrong output — it is a renderer deriving a
 * colour from a priority's DISPLAY NAME. That produced `class="priority-dot hoch"`
 * on a German install, matched none of the four hardcoded English rules, and drew
 * a transparent circle: no error, no fallback, nothing on screen to suggest a
 * setting had not applied. A behaviour test proves the renderer that exists today
 * is right; it cannot stop the FIFTH renderer, written next year, from reaching
 * for the name again because that is what its neighbours used to do.
 *
 * This is the same shape as GH #79 (every ticket intake path resolved its status
 * by the word 'Open') and the Watchtower counters before it. Three times now, so
 * the invariant gets a test rather than a comment:
 *
 *   1. NO stylesheet carries a per-priority-name rule.
 *   2. NO renderer interpolates a priority into a class attribute.
 *   3. Every place that draws a priority goes through TasksPriority.
 *   4. TasksPriority validates the colour and escapes the name, because both are
 *      admin-editable free text and the name is stored exactly as typed.
 *
 * Makes no database or network calls and writes nothing.
 *
 * Run:  php tests/tasks-priority.php
