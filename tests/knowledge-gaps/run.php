/**
 * Knowledge gap analysis — clustering harness.
 *
 * The interesting behaviour of the assistant is emergent: does a pile of real
 * tickets actually collapse into the right questions, and do the one-offs stay
 * out? You cannot answer that by reading the code, only by feeding it a pile
 * whose right answer you already know.
 *
 * Everything runs inside ONE transaction which is ALWAYS rolled back, so this is
 * safe against a live database. It also runs in "wording" mode by default, which
 * needs no OpenAI key and spends nothing — the clustering logic under test is
 * identical, only the similarity function differs.
 *
 *   php tests/knowledge-gaps/run.php
 *
 * ⚠️ Every negative assertion here is paired with a positive control. "The
 * one-offs did not cluster" proves nothing on its own — it is equally true of a
 * harness that silently clustered nothing at all.
